The main highlight of [Aspose.HTML .NET](https://products.aspose.com/html/net/) API is a conversion feature. Using our powerful library, you can convert XHTML to PNG format programmatically with full control over various conversion parameters. Any conversion you want to perform involves loading an XHTML document and saving it in the supported format. It can be different scenarios, but it can be made with a few required steps:</br></br>

<h2> Steps to Convert XHTML to PNG via C# </h2> 

1.  Load an XHTML document using one of [HTMLDocument()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html/htmldocument) constructors. 
1. Create a new [ImageSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.saving/imagesaveoptions) object. By default, the Format property is [PNG](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.rendering.image/imageformat). 
1.  Use the [ConvertHTML()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters/converter/converthtml/) method to save XHTML as a PNG file. You need to pass the HTMLDocument, ImageSaveOptions, and output file path to the ConvertHTML() method.
1.  The PNG file will be saved to the specified path.</br></br>

XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) is a text-based file format with markup in the XML, using a reformulation of HTML 4.0. These files are well suited to be opened or viewed in a web browser. The XHTML was designed to be more structured, less scripting, generic and device-independent. It uses all the existing XML facilities and more. The XHTML provides a generally worthwhile set of elements and attributes, with extension options combined with style sheets. Specifications for HTML 4.01, HTML5 and XHTML are being dynamically developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

PNG, Portable Network Graphics, refers to a type of raster image file format that uses lossless compression. This file format was created as a replacement for Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and has no copyright limitations. However, the PNG file format does not support animations. PNG file format supports lossless image compression that makes it popular among its users. With the passage of time, PNG has evolved into one of the most used image file formats. Almost all Operating Systems have support for opening PNG files.
