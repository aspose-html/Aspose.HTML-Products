Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to indicate formatting in plain text. MD files use Markdown language that was proposed and developed by John Gruber. They include inline text characters that determine how text is formatted, such as indentation, table formatting, fonts, and headings. Its design allows it to be easily converted to many output formats, but initially, it was created to convert only to HTML. Markdown is often used as a format for documentation and readme files since it allows writing in an easy-to-read and easy-to-write style. In addition, MD files can be converted to HTML, MD or images to take advantage of other formats for specific tasks.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents created for display in browsers. The latest variant, known as HTML 5, gives a lot of flexibility for working with the language. HTML pages are either received from a server where these are hosted or can be loaded from a local system as well. Each HTML page is made up of HTML elements such as forms, text, images, animations, links, etc. These elements are represented by tags such as img, a, p and several others, where each tag has a start and end. It can also embed applications written in scripting languages such as JavaScript and Style Sheets (CSS) for overall layout representation.
