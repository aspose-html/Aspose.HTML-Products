HTML files are frequently used to create, edit, or communicate a lot of information. The advantage of saving HTML as MHTML is that all of the web page elements are kept intact in a single file. MHTML contains an underlying HTML document and its embedded images, media, and other resources. There are various cases for HTML to MHTML conversion like reading from a URL / Web Page, WYSISYG Editor generated HTML or from a saved file. In all cases, any conversion requires some mandatory steps:</br></br>

<h2> Steps to Convert HTML to MHTML via C# </h2>

1.  Load an HTML file using one of HTMLDocument() constructors of the [HTMLDocument](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html/htmldocument) class.
1.  Create a new [MHTMLSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.saving/mhtmlsaveoptions) object.
1.  Use the [ConvertHTML()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters/converter/converthtml/) method of the Converter class to save HTML as a MHTML file. You need to pass the HTMLDocument, MHTMLSaveOptions, and output file path to the ConvertHTML() method.
1.  The MHTML file will be saved to the specified path.</br></br>

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents created for display in browsers. The latest variant, known as HTML 5, gives a lot of flexibility for working with the language. HTML pages are either received from a server where these are hosted or can be loaded from a local system as well. Each HTML page is made up of HTML elements such as forms, text, images, animations, links, etc. These elements are represented by tags such as img, a, p and several others, where each tag has a start and end. It can also embed applications written in scripting languages such as JavaScript and Style Sheets (CSS) for overall layout representation.

Files with MHTML extension represent a web page archive format that can be created by a number of different applications. The format is known as archive format because it saves the web HTML code and associated resources in a single file. These resources include anything linked to the webpage such as images, applets, animations, audio files and so on. MHTML files can be opened in a variety of applications such as Internet Explorer and Microsoft Word. The MHTML file format encodes the page contents similar to specifications defined in message/rfc822 which are plain text email related specifications. The actual specifications of the format are as detailed by RFC 2557.
