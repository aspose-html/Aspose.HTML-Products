 HTML files are frequently used to create, edit, or communicate a lot of information. HTML to XPS conversion is often required to establish limited access to document editing or copying. XPS file format provides access rights management and gives high-quality printable documents. There are various cases for HTML to XPS conversion like reading from a URL / Web Page, WYSISYG Editor generated HTML or from a saved file. In all cases, any conversion requires some mandatory steps:</br></br>

<h2> Steps to Convert HTML to XPS via C# </h2>

1.  Create a new [XpsSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.saving/xpssaveoptions) object.
1.  Use the [ConvertHTML()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters/converter/converthtml/) method of the Converter class to save HTML as an XPS file. You need to pass the HTMLDocument, XpsSaveOptions, and output file path to the ConvertHTML() method.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents created for display in browsers. The latest variant, known as HTML 5, gives a lot of flexibility for working with the language. HTML pages are either received from a server where these are hosted or can be loaded from a local system as well. Each HTML page is made up of HTML elements such as forms, text, images, animations, links, etc. These elements are represented by tags such as img, a, p and several others, where each tag has a start and end. It can also embed applications written in scripting languages such as JavaScript and Style Sheets (CSS) for overall layout representation.

An XPS file represents page layout files that are based on XML Paper Specifications created by Microsoft. This format was developed by Microsoft as a replacement for EMF file format and is similar to PDF file format, but uses XML in layout, appearance, and printing information of a document. It is, in fact, more justified to say that XPS is an attempt at PDF, but couldn't get enough popularity as owned by PDF for a number of reasons. Microsoft provides XPS Document Writer by default from Windows 7 onwards for the creation of XPS files. XPS files can be generated by selecting the "Microsoft XPS Document Writer" as the printer while printing the document.
