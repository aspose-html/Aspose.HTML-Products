In order to convert EPUB to BMP, weâ€™ll use [Aspose.HTML for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/html/net/) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for the C# platform. EPUB is an open XML-based format for digital books and publications that can be viewed and read on a variety of devices. EPUB conversions are often required to take advantage of other formats. It can be different scenarios, but any EPUB conversion can be made with a few required steps:</br></br>

<h2> Steps to Convert EPUB to BMP via C# </h2>

1.  Open an existing EPUB file.
1.  Create a new [ImageSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.saving/imagesaveoptions) object with BMP ImageFormat. By default, the Format property is [PNG](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.rendering.image/imageformat).
1.  Use the [ConvertEPUB()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters.converter/convertepub/methods/27) method of the Converter class to save EPUB as a BMP image. You need to pass the EPUB file stream, ImageSaveOptions, and output file path to the ConvertEPUB() method for EPUB to BMP conversion.
1.  The BMP file will be saved to the specified path.</br></br>

BMP files are bitmap image files that are used to store high-quality bitmap digital images. Thus, it may sometimes be necessary to convert EPUB to BMP. Please visit the documentation article [Convert EPUB to BMP](https://docs.aspose.com/html/net/converting-between-formats/epub-to-bmp/) to learn more about Aspose.HTML for .NET API conversion features and to consider C# examples for the most common EPUB to BMP conversion scenarios. In the article, you find information on how to convert EPUB to BMP using ConvertEPUB() methods, and how to apply ImageSaveOptions.

EPUB is an e-book file format that provides a standard digital publication format for publishers and consumers. The format has been so common by now that it is supported by many e-readers and software applications. For example, on Mac OS, the pre-installed Books software provides support for opening such files. In addition, there is a lot of compatible software available for smartphones, tablets and computers. EPUB file standards are maintained by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF).

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="BMP" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/" >}}
Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
