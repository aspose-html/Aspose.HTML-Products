In order to convert SVG to Image, we will use [Aspose.HTML for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/html/net/) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for the C# platform. SVG conversion is often required to take advantage of other formats. Using our document processing library, you can programmatically convert SVG to Image formats with full control over various conversion options with just a few lines of code.</br></br>

<h2> Steps to Convert SVG to Image via C# </h2>

1.  Load an SVG file using one of the SVGDocument() constructors of the [SVGDocument](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom.svg/svgdocument) class.
1.  Create a new [ImageSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.saving/imagesaveoptions) object and specify the ImageFormat. By default, the Format property is [PNG](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.rendering.image/imageformat)
1.  Use the [ConvertSVG()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters.converter/convertsvg/methods/3) method to save SVG as an Image. You need to pass the SVGDocument, ImageSaveOptions, and output file path to the ConvertSVG() method.</br></br>

<h2> Free Online Converter Live Demos </h2>
<p> Test the quality of SVG to Image conversion right in your browser! The following C# example demonstrates how to convert an SVG document. We describe the source code for reading SVG from a file and then converting SVG to Image with default saving options. Please load SVG from the local file system, select the output format and run the example. You will immediately get the result as a separate file.</p>

SVG files are Scalable Vector Graphics Files that use XML based text format for describing the appearance of an image. The word Scalable refers to the fact that SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. SVG document is a text file that describes images as geometric primitives: lines, curves, shapes, text, etc. Vector objects are constructed and stored as a set of commands, numbers, formulas, not in a pixel grid as in bitmaps. A text-based description of such files makes them independent of resolution. It is one of the most used formats for website building and print graphics to achieve scalability. SVG files can be viewed/opened in almost all modern browsers including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.
