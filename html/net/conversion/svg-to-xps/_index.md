In order to convert SVG to XPS, we will use [Aspose.HTML for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/html/net/) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for the C# platform. SVG conversion is often required to take advantage of other formats. XPS file format provides access rights management and gives high-quality printable documents. Using our document processing library, you can programmatically convert SVG to XPS format with full control over various conversion options with just a few lines of code.</br></br>

<h2> Steps to Convert SVG to XPS via C# </h2>

1.  Load an SVG file using one of the SVGDocument() constructors of the [SVGDocument](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom.svg/svgdocument) class.
1.  Create a new [XpsSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.saving/xpssaveoptions) object.
1.  Use the [ConvertSVG()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters.converter/convertsvg/methods/3) method to save SVG as an XPS file. You need to pass the SVGDocument, XpsSaveOptions, and output file path to the ConvertSVG() method.</br></br>

SVG files are Scalable Vector Graphics Files that use XML based text format for describing the appearance of an image. The word Scalable refers to the fact that SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. SVG document is a text file that describes images as geometric primitives: lines, curves, shapes, text, etc. A text-based description of such files makes them independent of resolution. It is one of the most used formats for website building and print graphics to achieve scalability. SVG files can be viewed/opened in almost all modern browsers including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.

An XPS file represents page layout files that are based on XML Paper Specifications created by Microsoft. This format was developed by Microsoft as a replacement for EMF file format and is similar to PDF file format, but uses XML in layout, appearance, and printing information of a document. It is, in fact, more justified to say that XPS is an attempt at PDF, but couldn't get enough popularity as owned by PDF for a number of reasons. Microsoft provides XPS Document Writer by default from Windows 7 onwards for the creation of XPS files. XPS files can be generated by selecting the "Microsoft XPS Document Writer" as the printer while printing the document.
