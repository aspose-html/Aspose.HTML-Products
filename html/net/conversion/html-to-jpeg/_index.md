HTML files are frequently used to create, edit, or communicate a lot of information. If you need to include HTML files in a PowerPoint presentation or send by email, please transform them to the appropriate image format and use as you want! With [Aspose.HTML for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/html/net/) API, you can convert HTML to JPEG format programmatically with full control over a wide range of conversion parameters. Any conversion requires some mandatory steps:</br></br>

<h2> Steps to Convert HTML to JPEG via C# </h2>

1.  Load an HTML document using one of [HTMLDocument()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html/htmldocument) constructors. You can load HTML from a file, HTML code, stream, or URL.
1.  Create a new [ImageSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.saving/imagesaveoptions) object with JPEG ImageFormat. By default, the Format property is [PNG](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.rendering.image/imageformat).
1.  Use the [ConvertHTML()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters/converter/converthtml/) method of the Converter class to save HTML as a JPEG file. You need to pass the HTMLDocument, ImageSaveOptions, and output file path to the ConvertHTML() method.
1.  The JPEG file will be saved to the specified path.</br></br>

JPEG is one of the most commonly used image formats. Its uniqueness is the controlled loss of quality during compression. This compression feature allows you to quickly and efficiently share JPG images and use them widely on the Web, computers, and mobile devices. Converting HTML files to the JPG image may be required, for example, if you want to add a web page in a PowerPoint presentation or send it by e-mail. Please visit the documentation article [Convert HTML to JPG](https://docs.aspose.com/html/net/converting-between-formats/html-to-jpg/) to learn more about Aspose.HTML for .NET API conversion features and to consider C# examples for the most common HTML to JPG conversion scenarios. In the articles, you find information on how to convert HTML to JPG using ConvertHTML() methods, and how to apply ImageSaveOptions or [ICreateStreamProvider](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.io/icreatestreamprovider) parameters.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents created for display in browsers. The latest variant, known as HTML 5, gives a lot of flexibility for working with the language. HTML pages are either received from a server where these are hosted or can be loaded from a local system as well. Each HTML page is made up of HTML elements such as forms, text, images, animations, links, etc. These elements are represented by tags such as img, a, p and several others, where each tag has a start and end. It can also embed applications written in scripting languages such as JavaScript and Style Sheets (CSS) for overall layout representation.

{{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JPEG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/" >}}
A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as a result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reducing the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image. The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. The format has been the choice for storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well.
