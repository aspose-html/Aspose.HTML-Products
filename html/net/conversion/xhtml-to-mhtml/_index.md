 The advantage of saving (X)HTML as MHTML is that all of the web page elements are kept intact in a single file. MHTML contains an underlying (X)HTML document and its embedded images, media, and other resources. With [Aspose.HTML for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/html/net/) API, you can convert XHTML to MHTML programmatically with full control over conversion parameters. Any conversion you want to perform involves loading an XHTML document and saving it in MHTML format. You should take some mandatory steps:</br></br>

<h2> Steps to Convert XHTML to MHTML via C# </h2>

1.  Load an XHTML file using one of HTMLDocument() constructors of the [HTMLDocument](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html/htmldocument) class.
1.  Create a new [MHTMLSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.saving/mhtmlsaveoptions) object. 
1.  Use the [ConvertHTML()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters/converter/converthtml/) method of the Converter class to save XHTML as an MHTML file.
1.  The MHTML file will be saved to the specified path.</br></br>

XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) is a text-based file format with markup in the XML, using a reformulation of HTML 4.0. These files are well suited to be opened or viewed in a web browser. The XHTML was designed to be more structured, less scripting, generic and device-independent. It uses all the existing XML facilities and more. The XHTML provides a generally worthwhile set of elements and attributes, with extension options combined with style sheets. XHTML provides flexibility and accessibility by subordinating all HTML presentation elements to style sheets. Specifications for HTML 4.01, HTML5 and XHTML are being dynamically developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

Files with MHTML extension represent a web page archive format that can be created by a number of different applications. The format is known as archive format because it saves the web HTML code and associated resources in a single file. These resources include anything linked to the webpage such as images, applets, animations, audio files and so on. MHTML files can be opened in a variety of applications such as Internet Explorer and Microsoft Word. The MHTML file format encodes the page contents similar to specifications defined in message/rfc822 which are plain text email related specifications. The actual specifications of the format are as detailed by RFC 2557.
