<h2><b>How to Convert HTML to PDF </b></h2>

HTML to PDF conversion is often required to establish limited access to document editing or copying, to produce official documentation or send some information, for example, by email. There are various cases for HTML to PDF conversion like reading from a URL / Web Page, WYSISYG Editor generated HTML or from a saved file. We describe the source code for reading HTML from a source file and then converting HTML to PDF with default saving options. </br></br>

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents created for display in browsers. The latest variant, known as HTML 5, gives a lot of flexibility for working with the language. HTML pages are either received from a server where these are hosted or can be loaded from a local system as well. Each HTML page is made up of HTML elements such as forms, text, images, animations, links, etc. These elements are represented by tags such as img, a, p and several others, where each tag has a start and end. It can also embed applications written in scripting languages such as JavaScript and Style Sheets (CSS) for overall layout representation.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for the representation of documents and other reference material in a format independent of application software, hardware, and Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. The PDF file format can contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become part of a source document.
