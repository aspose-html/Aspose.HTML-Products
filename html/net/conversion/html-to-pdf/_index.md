HTML files are frequently used to create, edit, or communicate a lot of information. Converting HTML to PDF is often required to protect documents from unwanted editing and copying, to prepare documents for printing or sending by e-mail, etc. There are various cases for HTML to PDF conversion like reading from a URL / Web Page, WYSISYG Editor generated HTML or from a saved file. In all cases, any conversion requires some mandatory steps:</br></br>

<h2> Steps to Convert HTML to PDF via C# </h2>

1.  Load an HTML document using one of [HTMLDocument()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html/htmldocument) constructors. You can load HTML from a file, HTML code, stream, or URL.
1.  Create a new [PdfSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.saving/pdfsaveoptions) object.
1.  Use the [ConvertHTML()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters/converter/converthtml/) method of the Converter class to save HTML as a PDF file. You need to pass the HTMLDocument, PdfSaveOptions, and output file path to the ConvertHTML() method.
1.  The PDF file will be saved to the specified path.</br></br>

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents created for display in browsers. The latest variant, known as HTML 5, gives a lot of flexibility for working with the language. HTML pages are either received from a server where these are hosted or can be loaded from a local system as well. Each HTML page is made up of HTML elements such as forms, text, images, animations, links, etc. These elements are represented by tags such as img, a, p and several others, where each tag has a start and end. It can also embed applications written in scripting languages such as JavaScript and Style Sheets (CSS) for overall layout representation.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for the representation of documents and other reference material in a format independent of application software, hardware, and Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. The PDF file format can contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become part of a source document.
