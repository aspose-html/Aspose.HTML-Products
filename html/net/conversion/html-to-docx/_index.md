HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents created for display in browsers. The latest variant, known as HTML 5, gives a lot of flexibility for working with the language. HTML pages are either received from a server where these are hosted or can be loaded from a local system as well. Each HTML page is made up of HTML elements such as forms, text, images, animations, links, etc. These elements are represented by tags such as img, a, p and several others, where each tag has a start and end. It can also embed applications written in scripting languages such as JavaScript and Style Sheets (CSS) for overall layout representation.

DOCX is a text-based file format with markup in the XML, using a reformulation of HTML 4.0. These files are well suited to be opened or viewed in a web browser. DOCX was designed to be more structured, less scripting, and generic; using all the existing facilities of XML and more device-independent. DOCX provides a generally worthwhile set of elements and attributes, with extension options in combination with style sheets. DOCX provides flexibility and accessibility by subordinating all HTML presentation elements to style sheets. Specifications for HTML 4.01, HTML5 and DOCX are being dynamically developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
