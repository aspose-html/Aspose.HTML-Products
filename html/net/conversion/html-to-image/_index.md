HTML files are frequently used to create, edit, or communicate a lot of information. If you need to include HTML files in a PowerPoint presentation or send by email, please transform them to the appropriate image format and use as you want! With [Aspose.HTML for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/html/net/) API, you can convert HTML to Image formats programmatically with full control over a wide range of conversion parameters. Any conversion requires some mandatory steps:</br></br>

<h2> Steps to Convert HTML to Image via C# </h2>

1.  Load an HTML document using one of [HTMLDocument()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html/htmldocument) constructors. You can load HTML from a file, HTML code, stream, or URL.
1.  Create a new [ImageSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.saving/imagesaveoptions) object.
1.  Use the [ConvertHTML()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters/converter/converthtml/) method of the Converter class to save HTML as an Image file. You need to pass the HTMLDocument, ImageSaveOptions, and output file path to the ConvertHTML() method.
1.  The image file will be saved to the specified path.</br></br>

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents created for display in browsers. The latest variant, known as HTML 5, gives a lot of flexibility for working with the language. HTML pages are either received from a server where these are hosted or can be loaded from a local system as well. Each HTML page is made up of HTML elements such as forms, text, images, animations, links, etc. These elements are represented by tags such as img, a, p and several others, where each tag has a start and end. It can also embed applications written in scripting languages such as JavaScript and Style Sheets (CSS) for overall layout representation.
