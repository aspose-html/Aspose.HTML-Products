 .NET developers can easily load & convert HTML files to GIF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load an HTML file using the [HTMLDocument](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html/htmldocument) class.
1.  Create a new [ImageSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.saving/imagesaveoptions) object with GIF ImageFormat. By default, the Format property is [PNG](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.rendering.image/imageformat).
1.  Use the [ConvertHTML()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters.converter/converthtml/methods/3) method of the Converter class to save HTML as a GIF image. You need to pass the HTMLDocument, ImageSaveOptions, and output file path to the ConvertHTML() method for HTML to GIF conversion.
1.  The GIF file will be saved at the specified path.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents created for display in browsers. The latest variant, known as HTML 5, gives a lot of flexibility for working with the language. HTML pages are either received from a server where these are hosted or can be loaded from a local system as well. Each HTML page is made up of HTML elements such as forms, text, images, animations, links, etc. These elements are represented by tags such as img, a, p and several others, where each tag has a start and end. It can also embed applications written in scripting languages such as JavaScript and Style Sheets (CSS) for overall layout representation.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="GIF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/gif/" >}}
A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly compressed image. Owned by Unisys, GIF uses the LZW compression algorithm that does not degrade the image quality. For each image GIF typically allow up to 8 bits per pixel and up to 256 colours are allowed across the image in contrast to a JPEG image, which can display up to 16 million colours and fairly touches the limits of the human eye. Back when the internet emerged, GIFs remained the best choice because they required low bandwidth and were compatible with graphics that consume solid areas of colour.
