HTML [input](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#the-input-element) elements with `type='text'` create basic single-line text inputs. Use them if you want users to enter a single line value. An on-screen keyboard will appear if you are using a smartphone or tablet. You can use this HTML Text Input Generator to create code which can be pasted into HTML. Just select options and get the text input on the fly!

<b>Note:</b> Text boxes are classified into two types: text fields and [text areas.](/html/{{lang.url-fragment}}net/generators/textarea/) These two text boxes serve different purposes and help users understand what they should be entering into the text field. An HTML `<textarea>` tag defines an area where you can enter multiple lines of text.

<h2> Attributes </h2>

With the input `type='text'` element you can use attributes such as *name*, *size*, *placeholder*, *list*, *required*, *spellcheck*, *maxlength*, *minlength*, etc.

- The `size` attribute is a numeric value indicating how many characters should be in the input field. The default width of the text field is 20 characters.
- The `placeholder` attribute is a string that gives the user a brief hint about what information is expected in the field.
- The `spellcheck` is an attribute that is used to indicate whether to enable spell-checking for an element.
- Add a `required` attribute to ensure users fill this field.
