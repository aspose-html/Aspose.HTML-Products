HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page and is made up of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
HTML documents consist of a tree of elements. Each element is denoted in the source by a start tag and an end tag. Elements can have attributes, which control how the elements work.
