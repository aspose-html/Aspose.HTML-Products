HTML Generators help you to add more HTML tags to your projects. HTML documents consist of a tree of elements. Elements can have attributes, which control how the elements work. Our HTML Code Generators consist of four groups - **Input**, **Media**, **Text** and **Other**. They help you create HTML elements for data input, adding media files, text design and others.

- The HTML `<input>` element is the most important form element. It is used to create interactive controls for web forms to accept data from the user. The `<input>` element can be rendered in several ways, depending on the `type` attribute.
- Web pages often contain multimedia (media) elements of different types and formats. It can be images, music, sound, videos, films, and more. **Media** elements like images, audio or video are stored in media files. Create HTML code for media elements using our HTML Generators!
- HTML contains several elements for designing and formatting text. In the **Text** group, you find code generators for highlighting, emphasizing words, making citations, and more.
- The **Other** group contains code generators for creating HTML elements like tables, iframes, hyperlinks, lists, etc.
