The `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. Using an HTML image element will certainly make your web page more interesting. Images are not technically inserted into a web page, but images are linked to web pages. The `<img>` tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

<h2> Attributes </h2>

 - The `src` attribute is required and includes the path of an image to a particular document. In other words, it is used to link images in HTML documents.
 - The `alt` attribute is optional but incredibly useful for accessibility. It contains a text description of the image that is displayed on the page if the image cannot be loaded for some reason.
 - It is recommended to always specify the `width` and `height` of the image. If these attributes are not specified, the page may flicker while the image is loading.
