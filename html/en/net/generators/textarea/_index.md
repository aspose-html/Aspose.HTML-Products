The [textarea](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-elements.html#the-textarea-element) HTML element represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, for example a comment on a review or feedback form.

<h2> Attributes </h2>

The checkbox usually contains a `name` and `value` attribute. This name/value pair will be sent to the server when the form is submitted. If the `value` attribute is not specified, then the reported default value is "on".<br>
You can generate an HTML checkbox input tag and checkbox C# code by selecting attributes such as `name`, `checked`, `id`, etc. Each checkbox is associated with a `<label>` element wrapped around the checkbox. Please always include a `<label>` tag for better accessibility!<br><br>
