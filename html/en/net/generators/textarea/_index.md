The [textarea](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-elements.html#the-textarea-element) HTML element defines an area where you can enter multiple lines of text. This is a multi-line plain text editing element, that allows users to enter large amounts of text in an arbitrary form, such as reviews, comments or feedback forms.

<b>Note:</b> Text boxes are classified into two types: text fields and text areas. These two text boxes serve different purposes and help users understand what they should be entering into the text field. A text area is defined by a `<textarea>` tag. You can define a small [text input](/html/{{lang.url-fragment}}net/generators/text/) box using HTML `<input>` elements with `type='text'`.

<h2> Attributes </h2>

A text area is a large text box where you can enter multiple lines of text, such as descriptions, paragraphs, and so on.

- A `name` attribute specifies a name for a text area. It is needed to reference the form data after the form is submitted.
- A `placeholder` attribute is a string that gives the user a brief hint about what information is expected in the field.
- A `spellcheck` is an attribute that is used to indicate whether to enable spell-checking for an element.
- `minlength` and `maxlength` attributes define the minimum and maximum number of characters the user can enter.

<h2> Create HTML Textarea in C#</h2>

[Aspose.HTML for .NET](/html/{{lang.url-fragment}}net/) API works as a headless browser that allows you to create or open existing HTML documents from various sources in order to perform editing operations such as removing, appending and replacing HTML nodes. If you want to use the HTML editing features in your product or programmatically add an HTML `<textarea>` element, see the C# example below. You can create a text area with a few lines of code:
