The [bdo](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-bdo-element) HTML element overrides the current direction of the text so that the text inside is rendered in a different direction. BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override. The HTML `<bdo>` tag specifies the direction of the content within it to be displayed in the browser from left-to-right or right-to-left. The `<bdo>` tag is useful for right-to-left languages such as Arabic, Persian and Hebrew.

h2: Steps to Create HTML BDO Tag in C#
---

1. Use the [CreateElement()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/document/createelement/) method of Document class to create a `<bdo>` element. In an HTML document, the Document.CreateElement() method creates the HTML element specified by tagName, in our case the tagName is "bdo".
2. Use [SetAttribute()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/element/setattribute/) method to add `dir` and other required attributes.
3. Create text content using [CreateTextNode()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/document/createtextnode/) method.
4. Use [AppendChild()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/node/appendchild/) method to add text content into the `<bdo>` element. 
5. Copy C# code for the HTML bdo tag and use it in your C# project.
