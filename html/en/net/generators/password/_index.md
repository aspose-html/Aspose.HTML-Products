[input](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#the-input-element) elements of type *password* provide a way for the user to securely enter a password.

The element is presented as a one-line plain text editor control in which the text is obscured so that it cannot be read, usually by replacing each character with a symbol such as the asterisk ("*") or a dot ("â€¢").
