An [input](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#the-input-element) element of type *password* allows the user to securely enter a password. The element is represented as a single-line text editor control in which text is masked so that it cannot be read, typically by replacing each character with a character such as an asterisk (*) or period (•). The password mask character is browser dependent.

<h2> Attributes </h2>

The password input usually contains a `name`, `size`, `placeholder` and `minlenght` attributes. You can set a minimum or maximum length for the password using the `minlength` and `maxlength` attributes. The `placeholder` attribute is a string that gives the user a brief hint about what information is expected in the field.<br><br>
