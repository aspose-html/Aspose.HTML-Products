The [HTML table element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/tables.html#the-table-element) defines an HTML table. It represents the information presented in a two-dimensional table consisting of rows and columns of cells containing data. An HTML table consists of one `<table>` element and one or more `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements that  define a table row, table header, and table cell.

<h2> Attributes </h2>

The `<table>` element can include global attributes such as `style`, `border`, `align`, `width`, etc.

 - The `border` attribute specifies the border width. A value of "0" means no border.
 - The `align` attribute indicates how the table must be aligned inside the containing document. It may have the following values: left, center, right.
 - The `width` attribute specifies the width of the table.
