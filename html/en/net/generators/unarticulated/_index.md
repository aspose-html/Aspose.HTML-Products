The `<u>` HTML tag represents some text that is styled differently from normal text, such as misspelt words. The content inside the `<u>` tag is typically displayed with a simple solid underline. <br>
Avoid using the `<u>` element where it could be confused with a hyperlink! So, it is not recommended to underline text unless you really need it. If you need to [emphasize text](/html/{{lang.url-fragment}}net/generators/emphasize/), use the `<em>` tag. Use the `<strong>` tag to give [strong importance](/html/{{lang.url-fragment}}net/generators/strong/) to the text. These elements were created specifically for those purpose, and browsers usually render this text accordingly.

<h2> Create Underline HTML Tag in C#</h2>

[Aspose.HTML for .NET](/html/{{lang.url-fragment}}net/) API supports a set of HTML elements that are defined in HTML Standard, along with rules about how the elements can be nested. You can modify the document by appending new elements, removing, or editing the content of existing nodes. If you want to use the HTML editing features in your product or programmatically add an underline HTML tag, see the C# example below. You can create the desired element with a few lines of code:

h2: Steps to Create Underline HTML Tag in C#
---

1.  Use the [CreateElement()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/document/createelement/) method of Document class to create an `<u>` element. The Document.CreateElement() method creates the HTML element specified by tagName, in our case the tagName is "u".
2. Create text content using [CreateTextNode()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/document/createtextnode/) method.
3. Use [AppendChild()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/node/appendchild/) method to add the text content into the HTML `<u>` element.
4. Copy code for the underline HTML tag and use it in your C# project.
