The [input](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#the-input-element) element with `type="checkbox"` defines a checkbox. The checkbox is an input field representing a binary choice. The exact appearance of the checkbox depends on the operating system configuration on which the browser is running. It is usually square but may have rounded corners. This is a form element that allows users to select one or more options from the given options.<br> HTML Checkbox Generator lets you create checkbox elements for your website. You can preview the checkbox and copy or download the generated HTML code.

<h2> Attributes </h2>

The checkbox usually contains a `name` and `value` attribute. This name/value pair will be sent to the server when the form is submitted. If the `value` attribute is not specified, then the reported default value is "on".<br>
You can generate an HTML checkbox input tag and checkbox C# code by selecting attributes such as `name`, `checked`, `id`, etc. Each checkbox is associated with a label element wrapped around the checkbox. Please always include a `<label>` tag for better accessibility!<br><br>
