h2: Generate HTML <s> Tag Easily!
---

The HTML `<s>` tag specifies text that is no longer correct, accurate or relevant. The text will be displayed with a line through it. The `<s>` tag is uses when you are trying to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, `<s>` is not appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the `<del>` and `<ins>` elements, as appropriate.

<h2> Create Strikethrough HTML element in C#</h2>

[Aspose.HTML for .NET](/html/{{lang.url-fragment}}net/) API supports a set of HTML elements that are defined in HTML Standard, along with rules about how the elements can be nested. You can modify the document by appending new elements, removing, or editing the content of existing nodes. If you want to use the HTML editing features in your product or programmatically add an HTML `<s>` tag, see the C# example below:

h2: Steps to Create Strikethrough HTML Tag in C#
---

1.  Use the [CreateElement()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/document/createelement/) method of Document class to create an `<s>` element. In an HTML document, the Document.CreateElement() method creates the HTML element specified by tagName, in our case the tagName is "s".
2. Create text content using [CreateTextNode()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/document/createtextnode/) method.
3. Use [AppendChild()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/node/appendchild/) method to add text content into the HTML `<s>` element.
4. Copy C# code for the HTML `<s>` tag and use it in your C# project.
