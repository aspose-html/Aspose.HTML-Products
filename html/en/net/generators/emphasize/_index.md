The `<em>` tag is used to define emphasized text. In other words, It is for a phrase with a stressed emphasis compared to the surrounding text. This phrase is often limited to a word or a few words and affects the sentence's meaning. The content inside the `<em>` tag is typically displayed in italic. A screen reader will use verbal stress to pronounce the words in `<em>` with an emphasis.

---

1.  Use the [CreateElement()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/document/createelement/) method of Document class to create a `<em>` element. In an HTML document, the Document.CreateElement() method creates the HTML element specified by tagName, in our case the tagName is "em".
2. Create text content using [CreateTextNode()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/document/createtextnode/) method.
3. Use [AppendChild()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/node/appendchild/) method to add text content into the `<em>` element.
