h2: Steps to Create Emphasize Text HTML Tag in C#
---

1.  Use the [CreateElement()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/document/createelement/) method of Document class to create a `<em>` element. In an HTML document, the Document.CreateElement() method creates the HTML element specified by tagName, in our case the tagName is "em".
2. Create text content using [CreateTextNode()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/document/createtextnode/) method.
3. Use [AppendChild()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/node/appendchild/) method to add text content into the `<em>` element.
