h2: Generate HTML URL Input Easily!

An [input](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#the-input-element) with `type='url'` defines a field for entering a URL. It only accepts null or a valid URL. This input value is automatically validated before the form is submitted. HTML URL Input Generator helps you to generate code which can be pasted into HTML. Just select options and generate the URL input on the fly!

<h2> Attributes </h2>

With the input `type='url'` element you can use attributes such as *name*, *id*, *size*, *pattern*, *placeholder*, *list*, *maxlength*, *minlength*, etc.
- The `size` attribute is a numeric value indicating how many characters can be in the input field. 
- The `placeholder` attribute is a string that gives the user a brief hint about what information is expected in the field.
- The `pattern` attribute, if specified, is a regular expression that the input value must match in order for the value to pass validation.
