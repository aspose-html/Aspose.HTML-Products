The *sup* HTML element specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.

The *sub* HTML element specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.

<h2> Attributes </h2>

HTML File Input Generator helps to generate HTML codefor input tag with `type='file'` by selecting attributes like `name`, `accept`, and `multiple`. 
 - The value of the `accept` attribute is a string containing one or more unique file type specifiers separated by commas. These can be file extensions including a dot, such as .jpg, .png, .pdf, or MIME type strings without extensions, such as audio/* - any audio file is accepted. If the attribute value is left empty, all file types are accepted. 
 - When the `multiple` boolean attribute is set, the file input allows the user to choose more than one file.
