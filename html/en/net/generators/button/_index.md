The `<button>` [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-elements.html#the-button-element) element is an interactive element that defines a clickable button. You can activate the HTML button using the mouse,  keyboard, voice command, or other assistive technology. The `<button>` is a type of form element that is used to submit, reset a [form](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#the-form-element) or open a dialog box. Once activated, it performs a programmable action.

<h2> Attributes </h2>

The `<button>` element's attributes include: *name*, *type*, *value*, *autofocus*, *form*, *disabled*, *formaction*, etc. But all of these attributes are optional. However, you should always specify the *type* attribute for a `<button>` element, to tell browsers what type of button it is, as different browsers use different default *type* for the button element.
Inside a `<button>` tag you can put text and add icons to your button to make it unique.
