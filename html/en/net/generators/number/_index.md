An [input](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#the-input-element) element with `type="number"` defines a field for entering a number. It includes a built-in check for rejecting non-numeric entries. You can also set limits on accepted numbers. HTML Number Input Generator helps you to generate HTML number input code which can be pasted into HTML. Just select options and generate the number input box on the fly!

<h2> Attributes </h2>

The HTML number input usually contains a `name`, `value`, `min`, `max`, and `step` attributes. <br>
- With the `min` and `max` attributes you can set the minimum and maximum values.
- The `step` attribute is a number indicating the granularity. The default step value is 1.
- The `placeholder` attribute is a string that gives the user a brief hint about what information is expected in the field. For example, "multiple of 2".<br><br>

<h2> Create Number Input in C#</h2>

Aspose.HTML for .NET API works as a headless browser that allows you to create or open existing HTML documents from various sources in order to perform editing operations such as removing, appending and replacing HTML nodes. If you want to use the HTML editing features in your product or programmatically add a number input, see the C# code example below:
