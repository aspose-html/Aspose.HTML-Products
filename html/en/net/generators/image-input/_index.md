h2: Generate HTML Image Button 
---

An [input](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#the-input-element) element with `type='image'` is used to create graphical submit button that takes the form of an image rather than text. HTML Image Input Generator helps to generate HTML code for an image submit button by selecting attributes like `name`, `src`, `alt`, `width`, `height`, and `autofocus`. Easily generate image button tag with HTML syntax!

{{< app/html/generator name="image-input" >}}

- The `src` attribute specifies the URL of the image file to be displayed to represent the graphical submit button.
- The `width` and `height` attributes specify numbers that indicate the width and height to draw the image in CSS pixels.
- The `alt` attribute provides alternative text to use as the button's label if the image cannot be displayed.
- The `autofocus` boolean attribute, if present, specifies that the `<input>` element should automatically get focus when the page loads.
