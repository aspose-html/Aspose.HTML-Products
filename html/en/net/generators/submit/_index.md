An [input](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#the-input-element) element with `type='submit'` is rendered as a submit button which submits the form to the server. When the user clicked the button, the user agent attempts to submit the form to the server. HTML Submit Input Generator helps you to generate code which can be pasted into HTML. Just select options and generate the submit button on the fly!

<h2> Attributes </h2>

A `value` attribute contains a string that is displayed as the label of the button. Otherwise, if you don't specify a value, the button will have a default label chosen by the user agent. If you want to disable the submit button, set the `disabled` attribute to it.<br><br>
