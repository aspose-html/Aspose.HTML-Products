h2: Citation HTML Generator
---

The **cite** HTML element is used to describe a reference to a cited creative work, and must include the title of that work. The reference may be in an abbreviated form according to context-appropriate conventions related to citation metadata.

{{< app/html/generator name="cite" >}}

<h2> Attributes </h2>

The `<button>` element's attributes include: *name*, *type*, *value*, *autofocus*, *form*, *disabled*, *formaction*, etc. But all of these attributes are optional. However, you should always specify the *type* attribute for a `<button>` element, to tell browsers what type of button it is, as different browsers use different default *type* for the button element.
Inside a `<button>` tag you can put text and add icons to your button to make it unique.

If you want to use the HTML editing features in your product or programmatically add a `<button>` element, see the C# code example above. This can be done with a few lines of C# code:
