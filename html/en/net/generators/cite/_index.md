h2: Steps to Create HTML cite Tag in C#
---

1. Use the [CreateElement()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/document/createelement/) method of Document class to create a `<cite>` element. In an HTML document, the Document.CreateElement() method creates the HTML element specified by tagName, in our case the tagName is "cite".
2. Create text content using [CreateTextNode()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/document/createtextnode/) method.
3. Use [AppendChild()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/node/appendchild/) method to add text content into the `<cite>` element. 
4. Copy C# code for the HTML Citation element and use it in your C# project.
