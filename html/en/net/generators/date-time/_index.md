The [input](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#the-input-element) elements with `type='date'`, or `type='time'` create input fields that let the user enter date or time, either with a textbox that validates the input or a special date & time picker interface. Date & time pickers are widely used to help users select the required date or time quickly and easily.

<h2> Attributes </h2>

If you choose input type `type='date'`, you create an input field that allows users to enter a date. The resulting value includes the year, month, and day.
The `type='month'` input type creates an input field that allows users to enter the month and year. The value is a string in the format "YYYY-MM", where YYYY is the four-digit year and MM is the month. The input `type='week'` creates an input field that allows users to quickly select a year plus the week number for that year, which can be from week 1 to 52 or 53. The input `type='time'` is used to create an input field that allows users to quickly enter time - hours and minutes, sometimes seconds.

HTML Date & Time Input Generator helps to generate HTML date & time input code that can be inserted into HTML. Select options and create a date & time picker!<br><br>
