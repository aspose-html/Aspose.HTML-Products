The [video](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#the-video-element) HTML element is used to embed a media player that supports video playback in a document. The `<video>` tag can contain one or more `<source>` tags with different video sources. The browser will choose the first source it supports. You can enable or disable various attributes to specify information such as the width and height of the video, whether you want it to autoplay and loop, whether you want to display video controls by default in the browser, and more.

<h2> Attributes </h2>

There are many options available in HTML Video Generator that you can use to generate HTML video tag code and then copy & paste it into your own website. You can enable or disable various options such as video controls, autoplay, looping, preloading, etc.
 - The video `preload` attribute specifies the video file should be loaded when the page loads.
 - The `src` attribute specifies the URL of the video to embed. But this is optional. Instead, you can use the `<source>` element in the video block to specify the video to embed.
 - The `height` and `width` attributes define the height and width of the video display area in CSS pixels.
 - The `autoplay` boolean attribute, if specified, will automatically start playing.
 - The video `controls` attribute specifies whether controls should be displayed or not in your browser. For example, if you disabled video controls and your autoplay setting is enabled, video will play but will not be visible in the browser. 
 - The `loop` boolean attribute, if specified, will automatically seek back to the start upon reaching the end of the video.
 - The `muted` boolean attribute, if specified, indicates whether the video will be initially silenced. Its default value is false.

h2: Steps to Create HTML Video Element in C#
---

1. Use the [CreateElement()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/document/createelement/) method of Document class to create a video element. In an HTML document, the Document.CreateElement() method creates the HTML element specified by tagName, in our case the tagName is "video".
2. Use [SetAttribute()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/element/setattribute/) method to add `controls` and other required attributes.
3. Create a `<source>` element and set required attributes for it. Use the CreateElement() method with "source" tagName.
4. Use [AppendChild()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.dom/node/appendchild/) method to add the `<source>` element into the `<video>` element. 
5. Copy C# code for the HTML video element and use it in your project.
