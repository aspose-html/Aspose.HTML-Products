The [input](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#the-input-element) type `radio` is used to create radio buttons. They are called radio buttons because they look and work the same as the buttons on old radios. Radio buttons are typically used to indicate a group item. Only one radio button in a group can be selected at the time. Radio buttons usually appear as small circles that fill or highlight when selected.
Checkboxes are similar to radio buttons, but radio buttons are designed to select a single value from a set, while checkboxes allow you to turn individual values on and off.

<h2> Attributes </h2>

You can generate an HTML radio button input tag and C# code by selecting attributes such as `name`, `id`, `checked`, etc. 
- The `name` attribute defines a radio button group by giving each radio button in the group the same name.
- The `id` attribute specifies a unique value that uniquely identifies an individual radio button in the group.
- The `checked` boolean attribute, if present, indicates that this radio button is the default selected one in the group.
