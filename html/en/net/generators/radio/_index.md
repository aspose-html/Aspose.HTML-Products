[input](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#the-input-element) elements of type radio are generally used in radio groupsâ€”collections of radio buttons describing a set of related options.

Only one radio button in a given group can be selected at the same time. Radio buttons are typically rendered as small circles, which are filled or highlighted when selected.
