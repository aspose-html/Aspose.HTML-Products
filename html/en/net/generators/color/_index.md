An [input](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#the-input-element) element with `type="color"` defines a color picker. It provides a user interface element that allows a user to specify a color, either through a visual color picker interface or by typing the color into a text field in hexadecimal format #RRGGBB. HTML Color Input Code Generator helps to generate HTML input color code that can be inserted into HTML.<br>
The control consists of a small button inside which the current color is displayed. Clic the color button to open the color picker with an initial value. A preview of the selected color is displayed inside the control.

<h2> Attributes </h2>

An initial color can be specified with the `value` attribute which accepts hex color values. Only simple colors without alpha channel are allowed to use. The `value` must be in seven-character hexadecimal notation. The `value` is never empty. If you don't specify a value, the default is #000000, which means black.

You can generate an HTML color input tag and color picker C# code by selecting attributes such as `name` and `value`. <br><br>

If you want to use the HTML editing features in your product or programmatically add a color picker, see the C# code example above. This can be done with a few lines of C# code:
