h2: How to Convert HTML Using C#
---

Hypertext markup language HTML is the language of the Web. Currently, most information is present on websites in form of webpages. So converting this HTML-based information into other formats like PDF, XPS, Microsoft® Word, Markdown and image formats is a common scenario. [.NET HTML API](https://products.aspose.com/html/net/) makes the conversion process easier for developers. It loads the file using HTMLDocument class, creates the relevant save options object and uses the [Converter class](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters/converter) relevant conversion method.</br></br> 
Any conversion you want to perform involves loading an HTML document and saving it in the supported format. It can be different scenarios, but it can be made with a few required steps:</br>
 1. Load an HTML document into a Document object using one of [HTMLDocument()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html/htmldocument) constructors. You can load HTML from a file, HTML code, stream, or URL.
 2. Create a Save Options object.
 3. Invoke one of the [ConvertHTML()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters/converter/converthtml/) methods and pass the required parameters to it.
