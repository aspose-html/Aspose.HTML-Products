If you would like to consider conversion functionality in your product or you want to convert EPUB to PNG programmatically, please see the C# code example above or learn the Documentation chapter. It can be different scenarios, but any EPUB conversion can be made with a few required steps:

1.  Open an existing EPUB file.
1.  Create a new [ImageSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.saving/imagesaveoptions) object. By default, the Format property is [PNG](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.rendering.image/imageformat).
1.  Use the [ConvertEPUB()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters.converter/convertepub/methods/27) method of the Converter class to save EPUB as a PNG image. You need to pass the EPUB file stream, ImageSaveOptions, and output file path to the ConvertEPUB() method for EPUB to PNG conversion.
1.  The PNG file will be saved to the specified path.
