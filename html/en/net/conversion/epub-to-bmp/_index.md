h2: Steps to Convert EPUB to BMP in C#
---

If you would like to consider conversion functionality in your product or you want to convert EPUB to BMP programmatically, please see the C# code example above or learn the Documentation chapter. In all cases, any conversion requires some mandatory steps:

1.  Open an existing EPUB file.
1.  Create a new [ImageSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.saving/imagesaveoptions) object with BMP ImageFormat. By default, the Format property is [PNG](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.rendering.image/imageformat).
1.  Use the [ConvertEPUB()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters.converter/convertepub/methods/27) method of the Converter class to save EPUB as a BMP image. You need to pass the EPUB file stream, ImageSaveOptions, and output file path to the ConvertEPUB() method for EPUB to BMP conversion.
1.  The BMP file will be saved to the specified path.
