SVG is an XML language for creating two-dimensional vector and mixed vector/raster graphics. In order to convert SVG to XPS, we will use [Aspose.HTML for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/html/net/) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for the C# platform. SVG conversion is often required to take advantage of other formats. XPS file format provides access rights management and gives high-quality printable documents. Using our document processing library, you can programmatically convert SVG to XPS image with full control over various conversion options with just a few lines of code.
