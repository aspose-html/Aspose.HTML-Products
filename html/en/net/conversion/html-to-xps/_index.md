h2: Steps to Convert HTML to XPS in C#

If you would like to consider conversion functionality in your product or you want to convert HTML to XPS programmatically, please see the C# code example above or learn the Documentation chapter. In all cases, any conversion requires some mandatory steps:

1.  Load an HTML document using one of [HTMLDocument()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html/htmldocument) constructors. You can load HTML from a file, HTML code, stream, or URL.
1.  Create a new [XpsSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.saving/xpssaveoptions) object.
1.  Use the [ConvertHTML()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters/converter/converthtml/) method of the Converter class to save HTML as an XPS file. You need to pass the HTMLDocument, XpsSaveOptions, and output file path to the ConvertHTML() method.
1.  The XPS file will be saved to the specified path.
