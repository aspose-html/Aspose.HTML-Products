In order to convert MD to GIF, weâ€™ll use [Aspose.HTML for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/html/net/) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for the C# platform. Conversions from Markdown to other formats go through the Markdown to HTML conversion stage. .NET developers can easily load & convert MD to GIF in just a few lines of code.</br></br>

<h2> Steps to Convert MD to GIF via C# </h2>

1.  Specify a path to the Markdown source file.
1.  Convert Markdown to HTML. Use the [ConvertMarkdown(`sourcePath`)](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters.converter/convertmarkdown/methods/4) method to save Markdown as an HTML document.
1.  Create a new [ImageSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.saving/imagesaveoptions) object with GIF ImageFormat. By default, the Format property is [PNG](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.rendering.image/imageformat).
1.  Use the [ConvertHTML()](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters.converter/converthtml/methods/3) method to render the intermediary HTML document to GIF image. You need to pass the HTMLDocument, ImageSaveOptions, and output file path to the ConvertHTML() method.</br></br>

GIF is a popular image format that is frequently used in web publishing. MD to GIF conversion allows you to save a Markdown document as a GIF image.  Please visit the documentation article [Convert Markdown to Image](https://docs.aspose.com/html/net/converting-between-formats/markdown-to-image/) to learn more about Aspose.HTML for .NET API conversion features and to consider C# examples for the most common MD to GIF conversion scenarios. In the article, you will find information on how to <a href="https://docs.aspose.com/html/net/converting-between-formats/markdown-to-image/#convert-markdown-to-gif" target="_blank">Convert Markdown to GIF</a> using ConvertMarkdown() methods and how to apply ImageSaveOptions.</br>

Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to indicate formatting in plain text. MD files use Markdown language that was proposed and developed by John Gruber. They include inline text characters that determine how text is formatted, such as indentation, table formatting, fonts, and headings. Its design allows it to be easily converted to many output formats, but initially, it was created to convert only to HTML. Markdown is often used as a format for documentation and readme files since it allows writing in an easy-to-read and easy-to-write style.

A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly compressed image. Owned by Unisys, GIF uses the LZW compression algorithm that does not degrade the image quality. For each image GIF typically allow up to 8 bits per pixel and up to 256 colours are allowed across the image in contrast to a JPEG image, which can display up to 16 million colours and fairly touches the limits of the human eye. Back when the internet emerged, GIFs remained the best choice because they required low bandwidth and were compatible with graphics that consume solid areas of colour.
