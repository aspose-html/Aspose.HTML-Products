h2: Steps to Convert HTML to TIFF in C#
---

If you would like to consider conversion functionality in your product or you want to convert HTML to TIFF programmatically, please see the C# code example above or learn the Documentation chapter. In all cases, any conversion requires some mandatory steps:

1.  Load an HTML document using one of [HTMLDocument()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html/htmldocument/) constructors. You can load HTML from a file, HTML code, stream, or URL.
1.  Create a new [ImageSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.saving/imagesaveoptions/) object with TIFF ImageFormat. By default, the Format property is PNG.
1.  Use the [ConvertHTML()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters/converter/converthtml/) method of the Converter class to save HTML as a TIFF file. You need to pass the HTMLDocument, ImageSaveOptions, and output file path to the ConvertHTML() method.
1.  The TIFF file will be saved to the specified path.
