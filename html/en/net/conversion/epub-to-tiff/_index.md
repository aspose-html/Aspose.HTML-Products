If you would like to consider conversion functionality in your product or you want to convert EPUB to TIFF programmatically, please see the C# code example above or learn the Documentation chapter. You can transform EPUB to TIFF with full control over a wide range of conversion parameters. It can be different scenarios, but any EPUB conversion can be made with a few required steps:

1.  Open an existing EPUB file.
1.  Create a new [ImageSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.saving/imagesaveoptions/) object with TIFF ImageFormat. By default, the Format property is [PNG.](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.rendering.image/imageformat/)
1.  Use the [ConvertEPUB()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters/converter/convertepub/#convertepub_27) method of the Converter class to save EPUB as a TIFF image. You need to pass the EPUB file stream, ImageSaveOptions, and output file path to the ConvertEPUB() method for EPUB to TIFF conversion.
1.  The TIFF file will be saved to the specified path.
