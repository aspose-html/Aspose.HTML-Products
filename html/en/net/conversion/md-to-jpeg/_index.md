1.  Specify a path to a source Markdown file.
1.  Convert Markdown to HTML. Use the [ConvertMarkdown(`sourcePath`)](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters/converter/convertmarkdown/#convertmarkdown_4) method to save Markdown as an HTML document.
1.  Create a new [ImageSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.saving/imagesaveoptions/) object with JPEG ImageFormat. By default, the Format property is [PNG.](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.rendering.image/imageformat/)
1.  Use the [ConvertHTML()](https://reference.aspose.com/html/net/aspose.html.converters/converter/converthtml/) method to render the intermediary HTML document to a JPEG image. You need to pass the HTMLDocument, ImageSaveOptions, and output file path to the ConvertHTML() method.
