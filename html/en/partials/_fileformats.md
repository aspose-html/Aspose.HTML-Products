{{<section HTML>}}

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents created for display in browsers. The latest variant, known as HTML 5, gives a lot of flexibility for working with the language. HTML pages are either received from a server where these are hosted or can be loaded from a local system as well. Each HTML page is made up of HTML elements such as forms, text, images, animations, links, etc. These elements are represented by tags such as img, a, p and several others, where each tag has a start and end. It can also embed applications written in scripting languages such as JavaScript and Style Sheets (CSS) for overall layout representation.


{{<section XHTML>}}

XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) is a text-based file format with markup in the XML, using a reformulation of HTML 4.0. These files are well suited to be opened or viewed in a web browser. The XHTML was designed to be more structured, less scripting, generic and device-independent. It uses all the existing XML facilities and more. The XHTML provides a generally worthwhile set of elements and attributes, with extension options combined with style sheets. Specifications for HTML 4.01, HTML5 and XHTML are being dynamically developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

{{<section MHTML>}}

Files with MHTML extension represent a web page archive format that can be created by a number of different applications. The format is known as archive format because it saves the web HTML code and associated resources in a single file. These resources include anything linked to the webpage such as images, applets, animations, audio files and so on. MHTML files can be opened in a variety of applications such as Internet Explorer and Microsoft Word. The MHTML file format encodes the page contents similar to specifications defined in message/rfc822 which are plain text email related specifications. The actual specifications of the format are as detailed by RFC 2557.

{{<section MD>}}

Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to indicate formatting in plain text. MD files use Markdown language that was proposed and developed by John Gruber. They include inline text characters that determine how text is formatted, such as indentation, table formatting, fonts, and headings. Its design allows it to be easily converted to many output formats, but initially, it was created to convert only to HTML. Markdown is often used as a format for documentation and readme files since it allows writing in an easy-to-read and easy-to-write style. In addition, MD files can be converted to HTML, MD or images to take advantage of other formats for specific tasks.

{{<section EPUB>}}

EPUB is an e-book file format that provides a standard digital publication format for publishers and consumers. EPUB files can store words, images, stylesheets, fonts, metadata details, and tables of content. The format has been so common by now that it is supported by many e-readers and software applications. For example, on Mac OS, the pre-installed Books software provides support for opening such files. In addition, there is a lot of compatible software available for smartphones, tablets and computers. EPUB file standards are maintained by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF).

{{<section SVG>}}

SVG files are Scalable Vector Graphics Files that use XML based text format for describing the appearance of an image. The word Scalable refers to the fact that SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. A text-based description of such files makes them independent of resolution. It is one of the most used formats for website building and print graphics to achieve scalability. SVG files can be viewed/opened in almost all modern browsers including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.

{{<section PDF>}}

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for the representation of documents and other reference material in a format independent of application software, hardware, and Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. The PDF file format can contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become part of a source document.

{{<section XPS>}}

An XPS file represents page layout files that are based on XML Paper Specifications created by Microsoft. This format was developed by Microsoft as a replacement for EMF file format and is similar to PDF file format, but uses XML in layout, appearance, and printing information of a document. It is, in fact, more justified to say that XPS is an attempt at PDF, but couldn't get enough popularity as owned by PDF for a number of reasons. Microsoft provides XPS Document Writer by default from Windows 7 onwards for the creation of XPS files. XPS files can be generated by selecting the "Microsoft XPS Document Writer" as the printer while printing the document.

{{<section DOCX>}}

DOCX is a text-based file format with markup in the XML, using a reformulation of HTML 4.0. These files are well suited to be opened or viewed in a web browser. DOCX was designed to be more structured, less scripting, and generic; using all the existing facilities of XML and more device-independent. DOCX provides a generally worthwhile set of elements and attributes, with extension options in combination with style sheets. DOCX provides flexibility and accessibility by subordinating all HTML presentation elements to style sheets.

{{<section JPEG>}}

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as a result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reducing the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image. The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. The format has been the choice for storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well.

{{<section PNG>}}

PNG, Portable Network Graphics, refers to a type of raster image file format that uses lossless compression. This file format was created as a replacement for Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and has no copyright limitations. However, the PNG file format does not support animations. PNG file format supports lossless image compression that makes it popular among its users. With the passage of time, PNG has evolved into one of the most used image file formats. Almost all Operating Systems have support for opening PNG files. For example, Microsoft Windows viewer has the capability to open PNG files as the OS has by default the support available as part of the installation.

{{<section GIF>}}

A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly compressed image. Owned by Unisys, GIF uses the LZW compression algorithm that does not degrade the image quality. For each image GIF typically allow up to 8 bits per pixel and up to 256 colours are allowed across the image in contrast to a JPEG image, which can display up to 16 million colours and fairly touches the limits of the human eye. Back when the internet emerged, GIFs remained the best choice because they required low bandwidth and were compatible with graphics that consume solid areas of colour.

{{<section TIFF>}}

TIFF or TIF represents raster images that are meant for usage on various devices that comply with this file format standard. TIFF has become a popular format for storing deep color images. It is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color and full-color image data in several color spaces. It supports lossy as well as lossless compression schemes to choose between space and time for applications using the format. The format is not machine-dependent and is free from bounds like processors, operating systems, or file systems.

{{<section BMP>}}

Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.

{{<section Image>}}

There are two main types of digital image files — raster and vector. Popular types of raster images include JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and GIF file formats. A bitmap is a two-dimensional array that maps colors to pixels at a particular location. A raster image is a much larger file than a vector one. Raster formats are suitable for photographs or pictures with color gradients. But one of their main disadvantages is losing quality when scaling. Because the pixel number is fixed, raster images can become distorted or blurry when resized to fill a bigger or smaller space. Increasing the size of an image with too few pixels can cause pixelation, which isn’t usually desirable.
