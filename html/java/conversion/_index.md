Whenever there is need of batch conversion of HTML files as well as web page from the live URL to other formats including PDF, XPS, Images and other formats, **Java HTML Parser API** is there to handle all such cases. API provides [HTMLDocument](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/java/com.aspose.html/HTMLDocument) to load the document, save options classes such as [PdfSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/java/com.aspose.html.saving/pdfsaveoptions), [ImageSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/java/com.aspose.html.saving/package-frame) etc for target file specific settings and a [Converter class](https://apireference.aspose.com/html/java/com.aspose.html/package-frame) for rendering to output file.
