 In order to render SVG to JPEG, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Html for Java](https://products.aspose.com/html/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-html) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Developers can easily convert SVG file to JPEG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load SVG file with HTMLDocument class constructor
1.  Call HTMLDocument.save method
1.  Pass output file path with JPEG extension
1.  JPEG file will be saved at the specified path

```cs
// initialize an HTMLDocument from a HTML file
HTMLDocument document = new HTMLDocument("document.html");
// initialize ImageSaveOptions with JPEG format
ImageSaveOptions options = new ImageSaveOptions(ImageFormat.Jpeg);
// convert HTML to JPEG
Converter.convertHTML(document, options, "output.jpeg");

 HTML API is an advanced web scrapping and HTML parsing library. One can create, edit, navigate through nodes, extract data and convert HTML, XHTML, MHTML files to PDF, Images and formats. Moreover, it also handles CSS , HTML Canvas, SVG, XPath and JavaScript out-of-the-box to extend manipulation tasks. Its a standalone API and does not require any software installation. ‎

SVG files are Scalable Vector Graphics Files that use XML based text format for describing the appearance of image. The word Scalable refers to the fact that the SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. Text based description of such files make them independent of resolution. It is one of the mostly used format for building website and print graphics in order to achieve scalability. The format can only be used for two-dimensional graphics though. SVG files can be viewed/opened in almost all modern browsers including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JPEG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/" >}}

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. JPEG image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and, hence, the name JPEG. The format has been the choice of storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well. Even the web browsers support visualization of JPEG images.
